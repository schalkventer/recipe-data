You must use a *zester* in order to avoid getting any of that bitter rind, and when you zest the lemons, zest them onto some sugar from the recipe (the sugar will 'catch' all of the oils).  I also advise you from personal experience to use only the best skinned lemons for the best flavor.",30,5,1999-09-05,Beverages,4,

All we had for a long time was the list of ingredients on the back of an old envelope.  We lost it for a good while and after I found it, I originally posted it so I would never lose it again.   Thank you all for all your interest ... this is my absolute favorite pie.  During the &quot;lost&quot; phase I must have gained 20 pounds trying numerous different buttermilk pie recipes ... I was so glad when I found it again as only a few even came close in taste and texture.  I've noted a lot of people mentioning reducing the sugar, which is fine, but bear in mind that the sugar quantity was a major difference between this and other recipes I tested when it was lost. Hey, it is a PIE, it is SUPPOSED to be sweet.  Enjoy",20,60,1999-08-30,Pie,8,

GREAT for company because it is so easy and yet taste wonderful! I cook this in the microwave, but I'm sure you could do it on the stove too. Times are what work in my microwave. Please use your own good judgment on times to use in your microwave. (In my quest to eat healthier, I now make it with light butter, light cream and reduced fat Parmesan cheese. It still tastes wonderful, but there isn't any guilt!)
PLEASE NOTE! This is an &quot;authentic&quot; Alfredo sauce recipe! Real Alfredo sauce *only* contains butter, cream, Parmesan cheese and pepper. It will be thin and there is no garlic in it! If you want a thicker sauce or one with garlic like modern restaurants serve, please look elsewhere! Recipe #52892 and Recipe #8596 are two good places to start.",5,10,1999-09-15,Sauces,4,

This is a simple scalloped potato recipe.  Everyone has their own way of preparing them, and I guess some people will like it and some won't, but this method is very similar to the way I make them.  The original directions gave the crockpot cooking method as the preferred method, with oven baking as an option.  I have reversed this option, since I don't do much cooking in the crockpot.  I hate to leave any electric appliance on when no one is at home.",25,90,1999-08-14,Potato,,

The Lemon Lovers Cookbook The Chicago Sun-Times  Peg Bailey has a passion for lemons.

Exotic  fare such as Aegean shrimp and  caviar mousse exist peacefully with all-American staples such as  carrot cake and lemon bars.

For the best retention of flavors, store flavored vinegars in the refrigerator or a cool dark place. If properly prepared, flavored vinegars should retain good quality for two to three months in cool room storage and for six to eight months in refrigerated storage. 
-=Attention=-
Should you decided to display pretty bottles of herb and fruit vinegars on a kitchen window sill. If left out for more than a few weeks, these bottles are then considered as decoration and not used in food preparation.",0,,1999-09-26,Apple,,

Here is what the original poster said about this recipe: &quot;You can take one of two approaches for the top crust here - a lattice top is more traditional and a little more work - the dough can be a little crumbly so you need to add a little water to roll it out.  You can skip the lattice and simply crumble the top crust dough over the jam and bake.  It will look more like a cobbler.  Either way will taste just fine!&quot;",30,30,1999-09-10,Bar Cookie,12,

d2bbc15f-967a-40fd-a4a9-f80b10fda1b4,Chocolatetown Special Cake (Chocolate Cake),Very rich because of the addition of buttermilk. I like to use Recipe #261024 for the icing. Or Recipe #95416 if I need to decorate the cake.,10,35,1999-10-23,Dessert,12,
93e902be-43f0-430d-b2ea-8482aaf28ca6,Dark Chocolate Cake,"While it takes slightly longer to prepare this recipe than a box mix, the resulting moist, delicious cake makes it VERY worth the little extra time. I consider this 'perfect' chocolate cake. This cake is excellent with  both with Recipe #261024 and Recipe #208959 (the dark flavor version). (I use Recipe #95416 when I'm decorating the cake.) I love how the leftovers are still moist even a day or two later. (I store my loosely covered with plastic wrap.)
My father adores this cake with Recipe #261024 on it. For his birthday, Father's Day etc. I make him cupcakes with the icing on them and individually wrap them. He keeps them in his freezer for when he wants &quot;a piece of cake&quot;. He claims they are as good as when they are fresh. 
(Even though it isn't where I got the recipe from so I can't vouch for it, reviewers have said it is the recipe on the Hershey's cocoa can. I would recommend using their Special Dark Cocoa if possible.)",10,50,1999-10-23,Dessert,,

Also, since I usually don't have pumpkin pie spice in the house, I use 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. cloves and 1/2 tsp. ginger instead.

You will not find a better Fettuccine Alfredo other than at Alfredo's in Rome, Italy. The secret to his sauce is in the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (don't even try this recipe without it), the balance of the pepper and nutmeg. For some reason restaurants never get it right.

Chili, to an aficionado, is more than a spicy stew; it is a  craving, a passion, for a simmered combination of meat and chile peppers  that warms the heart and inspires the soul.    The exact origin of chili is still shrouded in mystery. Some people believe it  wa  s originated by chuckwagon cooks who regularly prepared stew for the cowpokes  of the Southwest. Possibly, one of the these cooks ran out of black pepper and  in his search for a substitute, he came across some red chile peppers which were  common among the Indians and Mexicans in the territory that is now west Texas.  These undomesticated capsicums were extremely hot. When the cowboys inquired  about the source of the extreme heat, they were told that the heat came from the  &quot;chile&quot;, or hot pepper. Over time, this sizzling stew became popular in its own  right, and became known as &quot;chili&quot;.",15,120,1999-10-19,Southwestern U.S.,,

I've gotten several z-mails asking about the candy coating. They are wafers that you melt to then dip candies into to coat them. They are usually sold in the candy section of craft or baking stores. I've seen them in the candy making section of Wal-Mart also. If you look at the ingredients photo on Recipe #104941, you'll see a photo of them. They are a different 'stiffness' than white chocolate chips but some reviews have successfully used those when they can't find the candy coating. Hope that helps!",30,,1999-11-06,Candy,64,

The  reason I like this ice cream is because you can freeze it and it is like  the store bought hard ice cream. I do not eat it right from the freezer  because to me it is to creamy.

061984a0-71c1-47fa-9db8-f008dfeebc74,Cherry Pie,"I got this recipe from my sister-in-law when I got married and my husband's aunt had a cherry tree. It is our favorite! Prep time does not include the time it takes to pit the cherries or make the pie crust. ;) I use the Pie Crust recipe in the Fanny Farmer Baking Book. Recipe #13619 is the recipe for 2 8-inch crust. (I've found I have to refrigerate it for the pie filling to firm up and not be &quot;soupy&quot; when it has cooled. Once it has completely chilled, you can store it at room temperature and it doesn't lose its firmness. Or, store it in the fridge and warm it in the microwave a little bit before serving it with ice cream or whipped cream if desired.)",15,55,1999-11-24,Pie,8,

""These aren't difficult to make, but they look fancy because they  have three distinct layers.  A shortbread crust is topped by a  chocolate layer, which is then topped with a thin walnut layer. The bars freeze well, and they'll keep for several days at room temperature if stored airtight.  I've even mailed these successfully, wrapping them in pairs with the bottoms together and packaging them in a sturdy, well-padded carton before placing them in a similarly sturdy, well-padded box.  The most important thing to remember about these bars is that the chocolate layer needs some time to set up, even after the bars have cooled to room temperature.  I usually make the bars the night before I'm going to cut and serve them, but chilling the bars after they've cooled for about 20 minutes should have the same effect.""",45,20,1999-12-01,Bar Cookie,,

They always had them with lemon juice (she had a wonderful large lemon tree) and sprinkled them with sugar.  :)
The cooking time is approximate.

e055ddd5-1329-488a-8d8d-482a4b79deba,Minty Fudge Brownies,I adopted this from the Recipezaar account. They are more a cakey brownie when right out of the oven but get more fudgy after cooling. They have a nice light mint flavor. If you can't find the mint chocolate chips you can recreate with regular semi-sweet chips and a few drops of peppermint oil (as that is what makes the mint chips minty).,15,30,2000-03-13,Bar Cookie,12,

The mint flavour somewhat dissipates but it is still lurking in there!  As it was hot in my kitchen, the chocolate mixture never got to room temperature.  Therefore, mine never really &quot;set up&quot; properly.  So I froze it.  That worked beautifully!  It was like a fudgsicle in a pie shell.  It was somewhat difficult to cut but it wasn't impossible.  I look forward to making this again and again.  It was a great treat on an unbearably hot day!  Plus, it is nice to know that I have a special sweet treat hiding in my freezer just waiting for me!  (Chilling time is not included)",45,20,2000-03-13,Pie,6,

I personally leave the salt out, but that's because of doctor's orders and most people probably will like it better as is. The original recipe said 1 bunch broccoli, broken into florets, but the updated Zaar computer program won't accept bunch as a measure, so I've changed how that's shown.

ca40c365-91c7-4eeb-9dbf-d53d717d8327,Claude's Baked Beans,"Updated on September 16, 2009. I posted this recipe on Apr 22, 2001 and am embarrassed to say that just TODAY I found out that the recipe is missing an ingredient! I talked to 'Claude' and she (Claudia, actually) said that the recipe needs to include 1 can of condensed tomato soup. I have added the soup to the ingredients list.  The recipe received several 5-star ratings before I corrected the ingredients list so I guess that goes to show that this is a really good recipe!  Here is my original recipe description:

These beans are delicious. Even those who don't like baked beans love these. This is the recipe that I am requested to bring to every potluck. I've made them in the slow cooker also but I think they cook best in the oven. They are a thicker consistency when baked in the oven.",15,60,2001-04-22,Beans,10,

I make my batter early - keep it in the fridge, heat my pan, melt the butter, pour in the icecold batter and pop it in the 450F oven. Works every time.

Split you wafers before  placing in the pan but fit them tightly together--the grahams that split to approx 1x2 inches are ideal, but cut them to the size you like.  After you have made the almond roca and cooled the tray, put it in the freezer for only 10 minutes to really solidify the chocolate.  Then remove from freezer and flip the whole tray so you can see where the graham wafer splits are. It is then very easy to just slice gently with a knife and you get perfect cut pieces.
